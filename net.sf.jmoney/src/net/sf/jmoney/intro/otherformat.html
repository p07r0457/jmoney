<H2>Extracting Data from an Unsupported File Format</H2>
<P>
Even though JMoney has no support for the format of your current
accounting data, you have a few options:

<UL>
<LI>Someone may have written a plug-in to support the file format.
    Try posting a message on the jmoney-user@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
    </LI>

<LI>If you are a developer you may write a plug-in to support your file format.  First you
	must build JMoney from source (see the JMoney web site for instructions).
	You should implement an extension to the net.sf.jmoney.serialiseddatastore.filestores
	extension point.  This extension point required the implementation of two
	methods: one to read the data from the file and one to write
	the data out to file.
    </LI>

<LI>If the accounting software that you currently use supports export to
	Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) then you can export all your accounts
	and import them into JMoney by using the Import menu under the File
	menu.
    </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Importing QIF files into JMoney</H3>

Before you can import data into JMoney, you must first create an accounting session.
To do this, select from the menu File, New.
<P>
Now select from the menu Import, QIF format.  The open dialog supports
multiple file selection so you may select the set of QIF files and they
will all be imported in one go.  If you prefer to import them in multiple
goes, that is fine too.  Transactions that have entries in more than one
account will be correctly merged even if the accounts are imported at
different times.
