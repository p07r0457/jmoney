<H1>Welcome to JMoney!</H1>
<P>
This introduction will help you get started using JMoney.  If you are already familiar
with JMoney, you may close this wizard.  If you have used JMoney before it was switched
over to be Eclipse based then you can open your JMX files as before and, despite a different
look, you should have little difficulty using this new version of JMoney.

<H2>Importing your data</H2>

If you have already been keeping accounts on your computer using another application
then you will probably want to try out JMoney with your accounting data.
The first step is therefore to load your accounting data into JMoney.
<P>
Please check below the format of your existing accounting data.
If you do not have any accounting data which you would like to maintain using JMoney
then leave all un-checked.
If you currently have accounting data in more
than one format, check all that apply.
