<H2>Using a Proprietary Database as a JMoney Datastore</H2>
<P>
If you have accounting data stored in a database, you can continue to use
the same database as a back-end for JMoney.  There is no need for any data
conversion and, furthermore, you can use JMoney and you existing accounting
software side by side.
<P>
This does require some development work.  You will need to write a
plug-in that supports your database.  The plug-in must have implementations
that can materialize the various accounting objects (accounts, currencies,
transactions) upon request from data in the database and implementations
of iterators that return lists of objects from the database (e.g. a list of
all entries in a given account).  The plug-in decides what is cached in memory
and what is read from the database upon demand.

<H2>What if I do not want to develop a plug-in for my database?</H2>

If you do not want to continue to use your existing database then you
can more simply convert the data to a format that can be read by JMoney.
If you current accounting program supports export to Quicken Interchange Format
(QIF) then you can import your data into JMoney using QIF files.
<P>
If your accounting software does not support QIF or if the QIF export process
drops information that you want to keep then you can write a script to convert
the data to XML format (which can be read by JMoney) or you can write a simple
plug-in that can read your data from the database and import into JMoney.

<H3>Importing QIF files into JMoney</H3>

Before you can import data into JMoney, you must first create an accounting session.
To do this, select from the menu File, New.
<P>
Now select from the menu Import, QIF format.  The open dialog supports
multiple file selection so you may select the set of QIF files and they
will all be imported in one go.  If you prefer to import them in multiple
goes, that is fine too.  Transactions that have entries in more than one
account will be correctly merged even if the accounts are imported at
different times.
