<H1>Extracting Data from {0}</H1>
<P>
{0} {1} closed source and the file format{2} {1} not published.  The only way of
getting the data out of {0} into JMoney is to export to a Quicken Import File.
A Quicken Import File holds the entries from a single account only.  This mean every
account must be exported to a separate file.  {0} only allow{3} this to be done
manually, one file at a time!
<P>
If you have a lot of accounts and want to get started quickly, you may export only
a few accounts.  You may go back and export more accounts later.

<H2>Importing QIF files into JMoney</H2>

Before you can import data into JMoney, you must first create an accounting session.
To do this, select from the menu File, New.
<P>
Now select from the menu Import, QIF format.  The open dialog supports
multiple file selection so you may select the set of QIF files and they
will all be imported in one go.  If you prefer to import them in multiple
goes, that is fine too.  Transactions that have entries in more than one
account will be correctly merged even if the accounts are imported at
different times.
