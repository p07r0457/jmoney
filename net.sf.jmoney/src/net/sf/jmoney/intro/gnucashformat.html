<H2>Loading GnuCash Files into JMoney</H2>

You can load your GnuCash data into JMoney simply by opening the
GnuCash file from the File, Open menu.
<P>
You can try this now as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Place this wizard into 'Standby' mode by pressing the button in the
    lower right corner
    </LI>
<LI>Select File, Open... and open your GnuCash file
    </LI>
</UL>

Problems:
<UL>
<LI>There is no 'Open...' in the File menu:  You do not have
    the net.sf.jmoney.serializeddatastore plug-in installed.
    </LI>
<LI>The open dialog box does not list 'GnuCash files (*.*)' as a file type:
    You do not have the net.sf.jmoney.gnucash plug-in installed.
    </LI>

<H3>Saving the data</H3>

When it comes to saving your data, you have two choices.  You may
save it a GnuCash file, or you may save the data in the JMoney
format.  
If you save your data  in GnuCash format then JMoney will 
automatically load the accounting data from your
GnuCash file when it is started and will save it back when you
exit JMoney or select Save from the File menu.

<P>
The advantage of saving the data in GnuCash format is that you may
switch back and forth between using GnuCash and using JMoney.
(Just don't have both applications running with the same file open
at the same time).
<P>
The advantag of saving the data in JMoney format is that the JMoney
format can store accounting data stored in properties that were added
by plug-ins.  The GnuCash format, on the other hand, can store only
the properties supported by GnuCash.  The GnuCash format can store
all the properties supported by the basic JMoney plug-ins.  However,
other JMoney plug-ins may add properties to the accounting objects.
The JMoney format will always be able to store these properties but
the GnuCash format may not be able to store them.
<P>
To save the data back to file, select File, Save from the menu.
If you want to save to a different file or the data was not loaded
from a GnuCash file, select File, Save As.  Alternatively, if you
