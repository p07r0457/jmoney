<H2>Summary</H2>

Now you are ready to try using JMoney.
<P>
On the left you see the navigation view.  Some items in the list have child
items that can be seen by clicking on the 'plus' sign to the left.
To create a new account, select the accounts item and either press the
'Add Bank Account' button or right click to bring up a context menu.
A new account will be created and details of the account may be
entered in the editor area to the right.
<P>
Double clicking an item in the navigation view will open the editor
window for that item.  A few items do not have anything to edit or
view, in which case double clicking will have no effect.
<P>
You will probably spend most of your time entering account entries.
To do this, double click on an account in the navigation view.
This will open the editor for that account.  Select the 'entries'
tab at the bottom of the editor.
