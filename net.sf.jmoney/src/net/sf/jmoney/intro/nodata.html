<H2>Entering Accounting Data Manually</H2>

If you have no accounting data to load into JMoney, you will need to create
a new accounting session.  The following steps will do this:

<UL>
<LI>Select File, New from the menu
	</LI>
<LI>Either press the 'Add Bank Account' button in the navigation view
	(to indentify the button, hover on the buttons to get the tooltip text)
	or right click on the accounts item in the navigation view
	and select 'Add Bank Account'.  
	</LI>
<LI>Enter the details of the account in the account properties
	page.
	</LI>
<LI>Select the 'entries' tab from the bottom of the account page
	</LI>
<LI>Press the 'New Transaction' button and enter the data by clicking
	on the row in the entries list table.
	</LI>
<LI>Complain by sending an e-mail to jmoney-devel@lists.sourceforge.net when you realise that
	this page does not work well (or even better, fix the problems and send a patch).
	</LI>
</UL>
